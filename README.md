SQL  Table

Project Description: Car Model Database with PHP and MySQL
This project is a web-based application that manages and displays a database of car models, including their associated details such as creation date and manufacturer. The application is built using PHP (version 7 or 8) and a relational database like MySQL/MariaDB. It is designed to allow users to retrieve and display data in a user-friendly format. The final output showcases an HTML table with the required fields formatted for clarity.

Key Features:
1. Database Design:

A cars table stores the details of car models, including:
id (Primary Key)
model_name (Name of the car model)
date_created (Timestamp of creation)
manufacture (Manufacturer name)
2. SQL Query:

A query is used to fetch and format the date_created column into a more readable format (e.g., 21 Jan 2024 1:19 PM).
3. Dynamic Data Display:

PHP is used to dynamically generate an HTML table displaying the data retrieved from the database.
4. Date Formatting:

SQL's DATE_FORMAT function is utilized to ensure the date_created values are displayed in the desired format.
5. Responsive and User-Friendly Output:

The final output is rendered as an HTML table with headers and neatly formatted data for easy readability.
Technologies Used:
Backend:

PHP 7/8 for server-side processing.
MySQL/MariaDB as the database management system.
Frontend:

HTML for structuring the data output.
SQL Querying:

Used to fetch and format data efficiently.
Objectives:
To create a simple and efficient database-driven application.
To demonstrate SQL querying, data formatting, and dynamic content rendering with PHP.
To provide a clean, formatted table as the final output for end-users.
Use Cases:
Car Dealerships:

Maintain a record of car models, creation dates, and manufacturers for easy reference.
Educational Purposes:

Showcase the integration of SQL databases with PHP applications.
Small Businesses:

Manage and display product data using a lightweight web-based system.
